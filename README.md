# Football App (name still being decided)
Welcome to the official repository for our football app. There is still no name for it, but we will come up with one.

This app is expected to mix the best of every world when it comes to football applications.
Giving the option to look at results, upcoming games, stats, and more! The goal is to make a more interactive app,
allowing users to interact with each other by challenging them to a team creation mode or to see who accurately predicts the results of a game.

We are in early stages of development, currently brainstorming ideas to finalize the core functionality and modes the app is going to have.

We hope you are looking forward to it!
