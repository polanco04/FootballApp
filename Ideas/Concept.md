# FootballApp
## MAIN CONCEPT
### Functional Requirements
- App that shows games that are being played, will be played, have been played.

- Under every game, add a comment / live chat section in which users can share their own predictions before the game, talk during, share thoughts after.

- Make an AI that predicts the results of a game based on previous performances.

- Make a chatbot to chat about the game with user thats connected to the prediction AI. 

- Allow users to create an account. 

- Let the user customize their profile (choose a unique username, profile picture, banner, etc)

- create a challenge / betting system. Allows players to challenge someone or just bet for in-app currency. if they guess / bet correctly, provide them in-app currency. If they challenge someone and win, the loser gives the winner their in-app currency they provided for the bet. for example both users bet 300 in-app currency, the winner will take the other’s 300 and the loser loses their 300.

- Global "betting" by making a pool for it. (twitch style) 

- With in-app currency, let users buy more customization for their profile, such as banners, pfp borders. Also used to buy stickers to use in chat and comments! Special stickers like a team mascot or a player’s nickname.

- Team creation mode based on 2 teams, challenge someone else to a “who can make the best team out of the 2” and publish it and let other users decide the winner. Same concept with the challenges mentioned before in which the winner takes the in-app currency the other user bet.
